Linux 101 ran last Tuesday, and was a success (even if the projector didn't work until the end)! Thanks for coming everyone.

This is a short post to give people a link to the slides. Everyone who signed up for Linux 101 or filled out the feedback form will also recieve a link to download the slides. This will be sent out on Thursday, so if you attended but didn't fill out the sign-up form, make sure you fill out the feedback form before then.

The slides can be found here: <https://starbeamrainbowlabs.com/labs/Linux101>

Sections can be navigated with the up and down arrow keys, and slides within each section can be navigated with the left and right arrow keys.

Freeside has plans for further workshops in the series too:

 - 201: Securing a Linux server and setting it up to serve static files
 - 301: Deploying your own application to a Linux server, with all the bells and whistles

Unlike 101, 201 and 301 will be much more practical and take the form of a shorter introdiction, and then an instructional lab sheet - with Freesiders around to help you out - so keep an eye out for these!
